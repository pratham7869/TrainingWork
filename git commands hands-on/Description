I have made a project for learning git commands.
It was based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

first I had created a repo on github.
--> then i cloned it in my local using GIT CLONE command .
--> then i started working on it and then i add the work using GIT ADD command .  
--> the i commit the changes using GIT COMMIT command 
--> I tries to give a meaningfull commit message for every commit.
--> then i push all the changes on cloud repo which is on github .
I also practised git INIT command , Git CHECKOUT for branching .

I know so many commands of git but i have`nt used yet, but in case i have to used them i will do it. 

here is the link of repo on which i have been worked.
